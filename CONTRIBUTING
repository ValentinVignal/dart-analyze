# Contributing

We use changesets to manage GitHub releases and versioning.

- Run `npm run changeset` to start the process.
- Provide a release description; this will appear in the package changelog.
- Confirm with 'y'. A markdown file will be created in the `.changeset` directory.
- Open a pull request with your changes, including the changeset file, and have it reviewed and merged.
- After merging, a follow-up PR will be created automatically with generated changelogs and version updates.
- Approve and merge this PR to publish the new version to the GitHub package registry.
